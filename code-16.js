// What is an API?
// API full form is an Application Programming Interface
// collection of communication protocols and subroutines
// Thus api meaning is when an API helps two programs or applications to 
// communicate with each other by providing them with the necessary tools and 
// functions. 
// It takes the request from the user and sends it to the service provider and
//  then again sends the result generated from the service provider to the desired
//   user.


// How do APIs Work?
// The working of an API can be clearly explained with a few simple steps.
// Think of a client-server architecture where the client sends the request
// via a medium to the server and receives the response through the same medium.
// An API acts as a communication medium between two programs or systems for
// functioning. The client is the user/customer (who sends the request), the
// medium is the application interface programming, and the server is the backend
// (where the request is accepted and a response is provided). Steps followed in
// the working of APIs â€“

// The client initiates the requests via the APIs URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
// The API makes a call to the server after receiving the request
// Then the server sends the response back to the API with the information
// Finally, the API transfers the data to the client
